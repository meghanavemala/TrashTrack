# TRASH TRACK

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Trashtrack is a waste collection management system designed to streamline and optimize waste pickup operations. The system consists of two primary components:

A User App for residents to keep track of the days they have dumped waste, fill a form when they are not available at home and interact with a chatbot about queries related to waste management.

A Driver App for waste collection drivers to scan the users' QR code when they dump the waste and receive optimized routes for collection.

Features:

User App
1. Track Pickup: Users can track the status of their waste pickup in real-time.
2. View Collection History: Users have access to their collection history, including date and time of waste picked up.
3. Notifications: Users receive notifications about upcoming pickups and completed collections.


Driver App
1. Optimized Route Generation: Based on the pickup requests, drivers are provided with an optimized route that minimizes travel time and fuel usage.
2. Real-time Navigation: Drivers can use the in-app map with step-by-step navigation to reach each pickup location.
3. View Work History: Drivers can view their past pickups and performance statistics.
